# Error Handling

This project follows specific error handling patterns to maintain clean code and predictable error flows.

## Core Principles

- **Don't add try/catch blocks** unless specifically requested
- Let errors bubble up to be handled by higher-level error handlers
- The main error handling occurs in the CLI entry point [cli.js](mdc:cli.js)
- Use the centralized logger for error reporting [utils/logger.js](mdc:utils/logger.js)

## Error Flow

1. Low-level utility functions should throw errors rather than catching them
2. Strategy classes should only catch errors they can specifically handle
3. The main CLI entry point has try/catch blocks that:
   - Log the error using the logger
   - Close log files properly
   - Exit with appropriate error codes

## Logging Errors

When reporting errors, use the logger's error function:

```javascript
logger.error(`Error message: ${error.message}`);
```

For debugging purposes, stack traces can be conditionally logged:

```javascript
if (debug) {
  logger.debug(error.stack);
}
```

## API Error Handling

When dealing with Shopify API errors, use the existing utilities in ShopifyClient to handle and log them appropriately. Let API errors bubble up unless there's a specific recovery action.
